 File `fake_input_data.shp` contains example data for testing the origin detection mehtods. 
  The file contains the following information for 35 fabricated users:
  
 - `userid` : unique identifier for each user (pseudonymized)
 - `photoid` : unique identifier for each social media post (pseudonymized)
 - `time_local` : random timestamp for the social media post converted. 
 - `lat` : latitude coordinate
 - `lon`  : longitude coordinate
 
 
 The locations and time stamps don't correspond with any real data in order to avoid re-identification of data subjects.
