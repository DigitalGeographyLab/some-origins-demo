# Estimating the origins of people from social media: comparison of techniques

This repository provides supplementary information for the article *Estimating the origins of people from social media data: a critical comparison of measuring techniques*.


## Source data

- **Global posting history covering years 2010-2016 of social media users who visited Kruger National Park in 2014**
    - Based on publicly available data collected from the Instagram API in spring 2016
    - Each point has information of the related administrative areas (Contintents, subregions & countries)
    - This repository contains **de-identified and mocked demo data** in [demo_data folder](./demo_data). Geotags, timestams and userids are fake in this layer, but it allows testing the origin detection techniques.

*Results in the manuscript are based on data from 1375 users (33 % sample included in the expert assessment)*

## Origin detection approaches
- BASIC (no hierarchy)
- HIERARCHICAL ( Continent --> Subregion --> Country)
